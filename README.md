Currently under development.

Philip and Tarik, please share your comments and questions here :)

TODOS
- Push only the code not workspace
- Link the libraries outside the package
- Mujoco should be outside the package
- There shouldn't be user-specific path definitions: https://github.com/aykutonol/cito/blob/master/src/cito/include/cito_params.h#L21
- A simple example without mujoco
